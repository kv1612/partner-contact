Stock Warehouse Block Auto Configuration
========================================

The Stock Warehouse automatically create and update routes and rules
when we change the delivery steps/reception steps. When we change
routes or rules, we don't want them to be reset to default values.

This module adds boolean field which prevent modifying these routes.
