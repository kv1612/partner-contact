-- Since migration to version 13.0,
-- Odoo don't clean all model definitions when uninstalling modules correctly.
-- Then we need to clean them manually.

-- Remaining data in database will be cleaned with database cleanup.


-- Clean models, fields, constrains and relations metadata for uninstalled modules.
-- For models and fields, we only remove the metadata
-- because we can have several metadata on only one object.
