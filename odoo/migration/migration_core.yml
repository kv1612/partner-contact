# This Marabunta migration file will replay an upgrade for all standard and
# enterprise addons installed in a migrated database (by Odoo S.A. upgrade
# service) to ensure everything is working well.
# This database is also called 'naked database', meaning that no other addons
# excepting standard+enterprise ones are installed.
# It is used by the 'migrate-core' script.
